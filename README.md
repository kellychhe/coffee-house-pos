## Languages Used

This was created using EJS, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Node.js.

This is a group project that is pretty similar to my boba project. The difference is that any user can enter in an order. However, the barista has to log in to complete the order. When the order is completed the barista's name shows with the order on a different list. On the order form page, it shows when an order has been submitted and if it has been completed.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to filter the database by specified criteria in the get request and how to use EJS to target the different arrays.
